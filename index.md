Surface reconstruction library and CLI for particle data from SPH simulations, written in Rust.

## News

**2025-06-25**: We published Python bindings for the CLI of splashsurf and most library features üêç! Pre-built wheels can be installed using PIP: `pip install pysplashsurf`. See the [PyPI entry of pySplashsurf](https://pypi.org/project/pysplashsurf) for more information.

**2023-09-25**: The project now implements the paper ["Weighted Laplacian Smoothing for Surface Reconstruction of Particle-based Fluids" (L√∂schner, B√∂ttcher, Jeske, Bender; 2023)](https://animation.rwth-aachen.de/publication/0583/). 
It proposes a fast smoothing approach to avoid the typical bumpiness of the surfaces reconstructed from SPH simulations while preventing loss of volume for splashes and droplets that occurs with simple, non-specialized smoothing methods.
The images below show a rendering of a typical surface reconstruction (on the left) with visible bumps due to the SPH particles compared to the same surface reconstruction with weighted smoothing applied (on the right):

You can see this rendering in motion in [this video](https://youtu.be/2bYvaUXlBQs). For more details see the [paper](https://animation.rwth-aachen.de/publication/0583/) and the [readme](https://github.com/InteractiveComputerGraphics/splashsurf) in the repository.

## About

This project consists of the following crates:
 - üõ†Ô∏è `splashsurf`: Binary crate with a CLI (command line interface) to quickly run surface reconstructions of SPH particle data files from the terminal. Install with `cargo install splashsurf`.
 - üß∞ `splashsurf_lib`: Rust library that implements the reconstruction method used by the CLI. Allows integrating the reconstruction procedure directly into other Rust applications. Furthermore, it resembles a framework providing access to individual building blocks to create your own surface reconstruction pipeline.
 - üêç `pysplashsurf`: Bindings to the CLI and library for Python. Install with `pip install splashsurf` and see the [`README`](pysplashsurf/README.md) for more details.

`splashsurf` is a tool to reconstruct surfaces meshes from SPH particle data.
The first image shows the visualization of a set of particles from an SPH fluid simulation from [SPlisHSPlasH](https://github.com/InteractiveComputerGraphics/SPlisHSPlasH).
The particle radius is `0.025`. As the rendering of a fluid should not look like a ball pit, a surface mesh has to be
reconstructed from this particle data. The next image shows a reconstructed surface mesh of the fluid produced by `splashsurf`
with a "smoothing length" of `2.2` times the particles radius and a cell size of `1.1` times the particle radius. The
third image shows a finer reconstruction with a cell size of `0.45` times the particle radius. These surface meshes can
then be fed into 3D rendering software such as [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) to generate beautiful water animations.
The result might look something like this:
