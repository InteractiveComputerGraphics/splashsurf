## News

**2025-12-17**: We published a Blender add-on ["Splashsurf Studio"](https://extensions.blender.org/add-ons/splashsurf-studio/) for on-the-fly surface reconstruction during rendering using splashsurf in Blender. 
You can find it on the [official extension repository](https://extensions.blender.org/add-ons/splashsurf-studio/).

**2025-06-25**: We published Python bindings for the CLI of splashsurf and most library features 🐍! Pre-built wheels can be installed using PIP: `pip install pysplashsurf`. See the [PyPI entry of pySplashsurf](https://pypi.org/project/pysplashsurf) for more information.

**2023-09-25**: The project now implements the paper ["Weighted Laplacian Smoothing for Surface Reconstruction of Particle-based Fluids" (Löschner, Böttcher, Jeske, Bender; 2023)](https://animation.rwth-aachen.de/publication/0583/). 
It proposes a fast smoothing approach to avoid the typical bumpiness of the surfaces reconstructed from SPH simulations while preventing loss of volume for splashes and droplets that occurs with simple, non-specialized smoothing methods.
The images below show a rendering of a typical surface reconstruction (on the left) with visible bumps due to the SPH particles compared to the same surface reconstruction with weighted smoothing applied (on the right):

You can see this rendering in motion in [this video](https://youtu.be/2bYvaUXlBQs). For more details see the [paper](https://animation.rwth-aachen.de/publication/0583/) and the [readme](https://github.com/InteractiveComputerGraphics/splashsurf) in the repository.

## About

This project consists of the following components:
 - 🛠️ `splashsurf`: Binary crate with a CLI (command line interface) to quickly run surface reconstructions of SPH particle data files from the terminal. Install with `cargo install splashsurf`.
 - 🧰 `splashsurf_lib`: Rust library that implements the reconstruction method used by the CLI. Allows integrating the reconstruction procedure directly into other Rust applications. Furthermore, it resembles a framework providing access to individual building blocks to create your own surface reconstruction pipeline.
 - 🐍 `pysplashsurf`: Bindings to the CLI and library for Python. Install with `pip install splashsurf` and see the [`README`](https://github.com/InteractiveComputerGraphics/splashsurf/blob/main/pysplashsurf/README.md) for more details.
 - 🎬 `splashsurf_studio`: Blender add-on built on top of the Python bindings for on-the-fly surface reconstruction. Available from the [official Blender extension repository](https://extensions.blender.org/add-ons/splashsurf-studio/).

`splashsurf` is a tool designed to reconstruct surface meshes from SPH particle data. 
The first image illustrates the visualization of a set of particles from an SPH fluid simulation made using [SPlisHSPlasH](https://github.com/InteractiveComputerGraphics/SPlisHSPlasH).
The particle radius is `0.025`.
To ensure that the rendering of a fluid does not resemble a ball pit, a surface mesh must be reconstructed from this particle data.
The second image displays a reconstructed surface mesh of the fluid produced by `splashsurf`, utilizing a "smoothing length" of `2.2` times the particle radius and a cell size of `1.1` times the particle radius.
The third image showcases a finer reconstruction with a cell size of `0.45` times the particle radius.
These surface meshes can then be imported into 3D rendering software such as [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) to create stunning water animations.
The result may resemble the following:
